# Pixelart to Github Commits

This script aims to convert the pixels of an image to a matrix of numbers. Representing the number of commits.

It was made to be used with the [Gitfiti proyect](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti) , but you can change the output value changing hex_dict values with the desired hex to desired return value.

The result is printed as well as written in a txt file. It can be copied to the gitfiti repo directory and it should import it specifying the name on gitfiti script.

-   The pixel art **MUST** be made with the exact HEX values specified in the script, if not, change 'hex_dict' accordingly.

-   The height for GitHub activity is 7px
